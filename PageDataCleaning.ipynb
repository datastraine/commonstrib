If you download all of a page's data you get each metric broken up by the previously mentioned time frames. As such, some pre-prep is ideal. My recommendation is to only pull daily data and lifetime data of metrics you care about i.e. Lifetime Likes by Gender and Age. \n",

Once there you'll see a new floating window that will ask you what data you want to export by Page, Post, or Video data. Ensure that \"Page Data\" is selected and then click on \"make new custom layout.\" This will allow you to tell Facebook what data you are looking to download.\n",
